I have analysed, through SWIM procedure, one of the most common cancer, the Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma. SWItchMiner (SWIM) is a software implementation of a procedure, able to extract information contained in complex networks. Specifically, SWIM allows unearthing the existence of a new class of hubs, called “fight-club hubs”, characterized by a marked negative correlation with their first nearest neighbors. Among them, a special subset of genes, called “switch genes”, appears to be characterized by an unusual pattern of intra - and inter - module connections that confers them a crucial topological role. The dataset on which we made the analysis is composed by a set of genes monitored in two different conditions: normal and tumour. First of all, I have found, properly applying SWIM software, the set of ”switch genes” related to drastic changes in many biological settings. Once this set of genes has been found, I have applied an enrichment analysis with the web tool ’Enrich r’ that found out if our genes have a statistical significance with some processes and interactions in 4 different categories: Ontologies, Diseases/Drugs, Transcription and Pathways.

This project haave without doubts some interesting results. In the first part with SWIM we found a set of 340 switch genes that with the help of doctors and biologists, and with more advanced researches, could be an interesting starting point to fight the squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. In the second part of the project, thanks to Enrichr, I showed how the set of switch genes found has implication with some fundamental processes in the human organism, such as the cell cycle (with particular attention to the transcription process) and the DNA replication. The study of their interactions can make possible, in future times, really significant discoveries in the field of the medicine and biology.
